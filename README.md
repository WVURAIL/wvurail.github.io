### Writing Posts

To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

The post must have the following on the head (can copy paste with propr ):

```yml
---
title: Post title
layout: post
date: '2017-06-13 20:30:00'
permalink: '/blog/:title'
author: pranav | kevin
---

This is a blog post with normal markup stuff
```
